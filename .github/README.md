# brew-a-coffee

This is a demo of a Github action that I use to brew a coffee at home. It makes use of
[longshot](https://github.com/mmastrac/longshot), my command-line interface for Delonghi coffeemakers, running in the
simulator mode.

The process here is much slower than the real system as we need to download the list of cargo packages and rebuild the executable for every
coffee that gets brewed.
